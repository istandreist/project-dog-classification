# project-dog-classification
A classification model based on the VGG19 architecture to classify dog breeds.

This is the second project from Udacity's Deep Learning course. 

Open the Dog Breed - VGG16 folder and access dog-app JupyterNotebook.

I also made some experiments using the ResNet50 architecture (other folder).
